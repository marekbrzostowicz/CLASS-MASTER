## Description

This is a web application designed for educators, providing a comprehensive toolset to manage educational content and assessments. Built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it enables teachers to:

- **Create and Name Classes**: Easily set up and label classes for different groups of students.
- **Add Students**: Add students manually, or import them efficiently via Excel or CSV files.
- **Record and Manage Grades**: Track and save student grades, ensuring accurate and organized assessment data.
- **Generate Grade Charts**: Create visual charts to analyze and present grade distributions effectively.
- **Generate Custom PDFs**: Produce customizable PDF tests based on question parameters, including open-ended questions, multiple-choice (ABC) questions, and true/false questions. Users can set titles, points, and question types, and download ready-to-print PDFs.

The interface is responsive and user-friendly, featuring a clean design with a left panel for settings, a middle section for questions and grade management, and a right panel for listing generated PDFs. It uses a professional color scheme (#49536e for the settings panel and #ede7e3 for the background), ensuring usability across desktops and mobile devices.
